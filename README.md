# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the top and bottom performing schools on standardized testing for both math and reading. This informatuion was then compared against funding alocations for each school respectivly to understand if there were areas that required more funding or if there were schools that were underpeforming given their respective allocation of funding dollars. I assume that this information would then be used to drive incremental improvements to the lower performing schools and reallocate funds where there were either changes in student headcount or material degredation in performance due to under funding. 

## Challanges in coding 
Though i was able to successfully execute the needed code to omit Thomas high school's 9th grade reading and math scores i was unfortunatly unable to see a material difference in the analysis. I assume this is likley due to a variable that i could not identify not being altered in the way it needed to in order to represent the change from the module coding. for this reason i am unable to speak to the impact of ommitting these scores at this time.

### Conclusion
Though I was not able to see the difference in comparisons i feel that this project has given me a lot of great exposure to Pandas and its assosiated use of Python. the troubleshooting that i have activly doen has taught me a ton despite not being able to fully root cause the issue in the code.
